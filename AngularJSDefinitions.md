AngularJS Jargon

* Modules = Represent the components used in your application. And by using modules, it's going to make it much more easy to reuse your code in other applications or other parts of your site. Now web pages are going to be manipulated by working with the DOM object in either JS or JQuery and AngularJS is going to allow you to extend HTML tags and Attributes using something called, DIRECTIVES.


* Directives = Make it very easy to bind data directly to your HTML elements. Angular will use JS Objects to represent set data called the SCOPE. 

* Scope = Can be data generated on the web server or a database or a web service or a client side using AngularJS code.

* Expressions = Directly linked to the SCOPE or data and the advantage to this is that the page will be updated Dynamically as the data changes. Data Binding works as well so that whenever your data changes on your webpage, the Model is going to be updated as well as whenever data changes on the MODEL, your webpage is going to be updated!

* Services = There are many services provided for common tasks like AJAX techniques to dynamically pull data from webservices and other such things.
